  summary: 'A short series for useful links, tools, and ideas discovered online.',
  content: `<h2>Internet Finds: Launching the Series</h2>

<p>This new category is a home for quick notes on interesting links, tools, and ideas I run into while building products and leading teams. Each entry will be short, skimmable, and focused on why a link is useful.</p>

<h3>What to expect</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Brief summaries of why a link is worth your time.</li>
  <li>Practical takeaways you can apply quickly.</li>
  <li>Occasional themes, but not a rigid schedule.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How I will curate</h3>

<p>I will prioritize clarity and usefulness over volume. If a find does not help me learn faster or work better, it will not make the list.</p>

<p>If you have a link you think belongs here, feel free to share it.</p>`,
