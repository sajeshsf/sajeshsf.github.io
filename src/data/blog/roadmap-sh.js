<p><a href="https://roadmap.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roadmap.sh</a> is a collection of role-based roadmaps, skill trees, and checklists for modern software roles. It is community maintained, so the guidance stays current as tools and best practices evolve.</p>

<h3>Why it is useful</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Clear sequencing:</strong> The roadmaps show what to learn first, what to learn next, and what can wait.</li>
  <li><strong>Role coverage:</strong> Frontend, backend, DevOps, data engineering, cybersecurity, and more are mapped out.</li>
  <li><strong>Practical scope:</strong> Each node links to resources or explanations that clarify what the topic includes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How I use it</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Pick a role, then highlight the topics I already know.</li>
  <li>Turn the remaining nodes into a weekly learning plan.</li>
  <li>Use the roadmap during onboarding to align expectations with a new hire.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Good starting points</h3>

<p>If you are unsure where to begin, start with the role you want in the next 6 to 12 months and follow the first two or three sections. That quick pass gives you a realistic picture of gaps and the effort required to close them.</p>`,
