  summary:
    'A viral list of life-as-a-game rules, plus the earliest source I could trace.',
  content: `<p>The list below has been circulating online as a set of &quot;game of life&quot; principles. I tracked down the earliest source I could find so the original creator gets credit.</p>

<h3>Origin</h3>
<p>The earliest source I could trace is a reel posted by <strong>Noa Lindstrom Travel and Run</strong> (handle: <strong>@noareserrunt</strong>). The text appears on the Instagram reel and is mirrored on Facebook under the same name.</p>

</ul>

<h3>The principles</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>If you don't choose a main quest, one is chosen for you.</strong> The default path is school -&gt; 9 to 5 -&gt; marriage -&gt; mortgage -&gt; retirement. You're allowed to explore the other available paths.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Your spawn point is random.</strong> Some start with gold, others with intelligence or luck. You don't get rerolls. Complaining just burns playtime.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Your base stats are fixed.</strong> You roll them once. If you're naturally analytical, build with that. If you're physical, creative, or social, lean into it. Forcing the wrong class drains energy fast.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Your build is flexible.</strong> Base stats are locked, but your skill tree isn't. You can change careers, habits, and even identity. Respecs cost time, effort, and a bit of ego.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Failing isn't game over.</strong> The only real loss is quitting the run. Failures convert into practical XP if you keep playing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>XP only comes from action.</strong> Reading, planning, and watching others play doesn't level you up. Reps do. Boring, unglamorous reps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Consistency beats talent.</strong> Talent helps, but it's just a passive buff. Consistency is what carries you past most players who quit early.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It's a single-player game with co-op modes.</strong> You experience life through your own perspective, but the right partners, mentors, and friends can multiply your progress.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Side quests matter more than they look.</strong> Health, relationships, curiosity, and play don't seem productive. They quietly unlock late-game perks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>You decide what winning means.</strong> Money. Freedom. Mastery. Peace. There's no leaderboard. Pick your ending before the credits roll.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Final rule</h3>
<p>Life isn't as hard as it pretends to be. You're freer than you've been told. You're allowed to choose a different path. You're allowed to dream. You're allowed to play your own way.</p>`,
