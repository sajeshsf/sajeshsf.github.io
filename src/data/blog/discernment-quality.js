  content: `<h2>Discernment: The Quality Behind Great Decisions</h2>

<p>Discernment is the ability to notice what matters, test assumptions, and choose the right next step. It is not about having more information. It is about having better judgment in the presence of uncertainty.</p>

<h3>Why it matters</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Protects time and attention:</strong> You learn to say no to good options so you can say yes to the right ones.</li>
  <li><strong>Improves outcomes:</strong> You separate facts from interpretations and reduce reactive choices.</li>
  <li><strong>Builds trust:</strong> People follow leaders who choose consistently, not impulsively.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What discernment looks like</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Asking "What is the real problem we are solving?"</li>
  <li>Making room for nuance instead of rushing to first answers.</li>
  <li>Considering second-order effects before committing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to strengthen it</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Write down your assumptions and test them early.</li>
  <li>Seek disconfirming evidence, not just supportive signals.</li>
  <li>Use a decision journal to learn from past choices.</li>
  <li>Slow down for high-stakes decisions and speed up for reversible ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>This page will grow with examples, frameworks, and decision tools over time.</p>`,
