  content: `<h2>1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die</h2>

<p>This book is less of a checklist and more of a listening map. It is a curated list of albums across decades and genres, with short notes that explain why each record mattered in its moment. I use it as a guide for exploration, not a test I need to pass.</p>

<h3>What the book gives you</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Context in small doses.</strong> Each album gets a short write-up that explains the cultural moment, the sound, or the innovation.</li>
  <li><strong>Range.</strong> It covers everything from early recordings to modern releases, which makes it ideal for discovering styles you would never search for directly.</li>
  <li><strong>Momentum.</strong> The format encourages steady listening. You can open to any page and have a clear next step.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How I use it</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pick a decade and go deep.</strong> I will spend a month in one era to understand how the sound evolved.</li>
  <li><strong>Alternate familiar and unfamiliar.</strong> One album I already love, one I have never heard. It keeps curiosity high.</li>
  <li><strong>Take quick notes.</strong> A few lines on what stood out is enough to remember why I liked (or did not like) a record.</li>
</ul>

<h3>A simple listening plan</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Choose 5 albums for the week.</li>
  <li>Listen once for overall vibe, then once for detail.</li>
  <li>Write down one sentence you can reuse later (favorite track, best moment, standout instrument).</li>
  <li>Share one album with a friend to get a second perspective.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Why it works for long-term discovery</h3>
<p>The book does not try to be definitive. Instead, it gives you enough structure to explore with confidence. If you have ever felt lost in the size of music history, this is a friendly way to build a path.</p>

<h3>Who it is for</h3>
<p>Anyone who wants breadth, context, and a reason to keep listening. You do not need to finish it. You just need to keep turning the page.</p>`,
