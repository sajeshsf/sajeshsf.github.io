<p>SOC 2 is an auditing procedure that ensures your service providers securely manage your data to protect the interests of your organization and the privacy of its clients. For security-conscious businesses, SOC 2 compliance is a requirement.</p>

<h3>What is SOC 2</h3>

<p>SOC 2 defines criteria for managing customer data based on five "trust service principles"—security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality and privacy. Developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA). Unlike PCI DSS, which has very rigid requirements, SOC 2 reports are unique to each organization. In line with specific business practices, each designs its own controls to comply with one or more of the trust principles.</p>

<p>There are two types of SOC reports:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Type I</strong> describes a vendor's systems and whether their design is suitable to meet relevant trust principles.</li>
  <li><strong>Type II</strong> details the operational effectiveness of those systems.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Type 1 vs. Type 2 Reports</h3>

<p>You will typically hear organizations talk about "passing" a Type 1 or Type 2 audit.</p>

<p><strong>Type 1 (The Snapshot):</strong> Evaluates whether your controls are designed correctly at a specific point in time. It is faster and cheaper, often used to close an immediate deal.</p>

<p><strong>Type 2 (The Video):</strong> Evaluates the operational effectiveness of those controls over a period of time (usually 3–12 months). This is the gold standard for proving long-term reliability.</p>

<h3>Why It Matters</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Customer Trust:</strong> It's often a "deal-breaker" for enterprise sales; many big companies won't sign a contract without seeing a SOC 2 report.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk Mitigation:</strong> It forces you to document and test your security, reducing the likelihood of a data breach.</li>
  <li><strong>Competitive Edge:</strong> It distinguishes you from competitors who haven't undergone the rigorous third-party audit process.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Path to Compliance</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Scope & Gap Analysis:</strong> Decide which TSCs apply and find where your current security is lacking.</li>
  <li><strong>Remediation:</strong> Implement the necessary controls (e.g., formalizing an employee offboarding process or setting up centralized logging).</li>
  <li><strong>Audit Period:</strong> For Type 2, you enter a "monitoring window" where you must prove your controls work every day.</li>
  <li><strong>The Audit:</strong> An independent CPA firm reviews your evidence and issues the final report.</li>
</ul>`,
