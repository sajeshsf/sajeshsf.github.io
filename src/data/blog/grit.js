  content: `<h2>Grit: Staying the Course</h2>

<p>Grit is the blend of long-term commitment and consistent effort. It is not just intensity for a week; it is the ability to keep showing up when the novelty fades and the work gets repetitive. This page is a starter draft I will expand with examples and references.</p>

<h3>Working definition</h3>

<p>For me, grit is the combination of:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Clarity</strong> about the goal you are chasing.</li>
  <li><strong>Consistency</strong> in the small actions that compound over time.</li>
  <li><strong>Resilience</strong> when progress is slow or feedback is hard.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why it matters for builders</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Long cycles:</strong> meaningful products take months or years to mature.</li>
  <li><strong>Uncertainty:</strong> the path is rarely linear; grit keeps momentum alive.</li>
  <li><strong>Trust:</strong> steady follow-through is how teams earn confidence.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How I try to build it</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Make the goal visible.</strong> Keep a simple statement of the goal and why it matters.</li>
  <li><strong>Design the environment.</strong> Remove easy distractions and make the next action obvious.</li>
  <li><strong>Use small checkpoints.</strong> Weekly milestones keep the long-term goal within reach.</li>
  <li><strong>Seek honest feedback.</strong> Grit grows when you can adapt without giving up.</li>
  <li><strong>Protect recovery.</strong> Rest is a prerequisite for sustained effort.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Signals I am on track</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I can explain the next step in one sentence.</li>
  <li>I am making progress even when motivation dips.</li>
  <li>I am willing to refine the plan without abandoning it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next additions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Notes from research and books on grit.</li>
  <li>Stories from past projects where persistence changed outcomes.</li>
  <li>How to balance grit with rest and recalibration.</li>
</ul>`,
